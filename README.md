# The Engineering Team Knowledge Repository
## UL Standards & Engagement Engineering Team  
### Most Treasured Technical Resources  

**The Engineering Team Knowledge Repository**, where we keep our team's most treasured technical resources in a secure area for your use.  As the team develops new content, including articles, tech talks, and materials that support UL Standards & Engagement initiatives, we will share this information via the [Engineering Vault SharePoint Site](https://ul.sharepoint.com/sites/Standards2/SitePages/Standards-Engineering-Team.aspx) and The Engineering Team Knowledge Repository.

**The Engineering Team's focus** is Rigor within the standards development process. Our ambition is to use safety science in action by applying data analytics, engineering, and scientific knowledge to improve safety, guided by our North Star (saving lives, reducing injury, decreasing damage, and preventing further environmental degradation).

**Contained in the Engineering Team Knowledge Repository** are technical reports and other published technical information available to UL Standards and Engagement to support standards development.  Each wiki page will provide downloadable materials, when available, the purpose of the information, and additional resources related to the topic. Much of this information is also available on the [Engineering Team's SharePoint site](https://ul.sharepoint.com/sites/Standards2/SitePages/Standards-Engineering-Team.aspx).
